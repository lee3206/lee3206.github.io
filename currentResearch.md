## Current Research Projects

New projects will be listed soon! (Fall 2018)

### Changed Personality on Social Media
We investigated people’s perceptions of self in social media using personality. We first compared offline and Facebook traits on the OCEAN personality scale and found that on Facebook people were less Neurotic, Open, and Agreeable.
A second study compared Facebook, Snapchat, and offline traits and found that Facebook was still less neurotic and Open than offline, but Snapchat was more Extravert than either and more Open than Facebook.
These differences seem to be drawn from affordances of the media. For example, people’s anxiety about social judgement leads to curation of online social media posts to appear less Neurotic. In addition, one of the unique aspects of Snapchat (the transience of the posts) promotes greater Extraversion.
We have conducted a third study comparing texting, video chat, and offline personality traits, as a way to explore media other than social media. We again see differences between the media, although results are not yet completed.
We are also expanding into Instagram, comparing Instagram and fake Instagram (“Finsta”) accounts. We are interesting in comparing the two where the affordances of the social media are held constant while the audience might be very different.

This project is still in progress (Fall 2018). Please email if you are interested in collaborating.
