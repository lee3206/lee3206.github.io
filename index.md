## Main
My research focus is on how interactions using computers can influence both the interactions and those interacting. In particular, I am interested in better understanding how use of social media can influence us and our personalities and why people might describe themselves as “addicted” to social media. In addition to this main line of research, I am interested in online dating and how that influences mate selection, video games, and potential interventions for unwanted media use. My earliest research also involved what influences people to have a desire to “escape the self”, understanding why people might irrationally hold on to things they no longer want, and how people used Myspace and Facebook messages to talk to deceased users.

## Social Media and Personality
We found that people reported consistently different personalities on different social media. This is, we think, because of the affordances of each social media, aspects that encourage different expressions of personality. For example, Snapchat has ephemeral Snaps, while Facebook has posts that persist for a long period of time.

## "Escape the Self" Through Social Media
We attempt to fill a gap in the literature by connecting the escape from self model to Facebook use and other behaviors. We experimentally tested if Facebook and puzzle solving follow the escape from self model. However, we found that the model may not be effective at explaining excessive Facebook use.

## Clinging to Our Clutter
Using the implicit associations task (IAT) and pictures of peoples own possessions, we found that possessions that were considered special because of a connection, or those that had hedonistic characteristics are considered more a part of their self concept. Items considered clutter were in-between special objects and unowned objects indicating that we consider clutter to some degree part of our self concept.

## Grief Stricken in A Crowd
We created a coding system to identify messages to deceased MySpace users that indicated potential emotional distress. We found that linguistic style can be an indicator of said emotional distress and that natural language processing can potentially be used to automatically detect bereavement-related distress.
